# triangle

When I was a teacher I saw an amazing series called [Everything is a Remix](https://vimeo.com/139094998).
This mini documentary explores how people learn:
* Copy
  * we all naturally begin the learning process by copying others
* Transform
  * we start to experiment with what we've copied by changing it
* Combine
  * we then combine what we've learned from copying and transforming with other things we know

**This is the process that I took to create this program.**
*We stand on the shoulders of giants.*
* After being given this assignment I did some research and learned more about this triangle problem from [MathBlog](https://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-18/)
* I looked at the C# examples on the MathBlog page, then I started figuring out how I would solve this problem using JavaScript
* I then did a lot of refactoring and commenting to make the program more presentable and elegant


**Note**
This program requires Node.js

In the terminal execute
```console
node triangle.js
```

then the user will be prompted
```console
